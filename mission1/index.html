            Professor Bairstone and Dr Day have made a sensational discovery.<br />
            They have discovered the Monk Diamond in a remote cave in
            Siberia.<br />
            Professor Bairstone's dog, Ernest sniffed out the diamond.

            The team thinks the diamond had been hidden by the thieves.<br />
            They sent this photo from their camp:
